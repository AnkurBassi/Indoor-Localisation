# Indoor Localisation using Transformers
## Cyber Physical Systems


[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

Our project’s aim is to predict position of smartphones based on the real time sensor data, provided by indoor positioning technology company XYZ10 in partnership with Microsoft Research. The main task is to predict the floor and waypoint at specific time provided in the file named submission.csv from the existing data of site path file.

Below is the link to dataset.

## Features
- Use https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ub63rTg8ZU4WTgvU0xiizqlxBFwfzfgC?usp=sharing 
to access the notebook to start away directly with the hyperparameter tuning

- All the data can be downloaded from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1--XrdfzFElOb1gPBv_aeMe1doX_Yo2WN?usp=drive_link. The jupyter notebook file "Copy of cps part_2.ipynb" can be run locally just replace the indoor-location-competition with downloaded folder

- In the above notebook we are directly using the preprocessed data, to delve deep into data preprocessing kindly follow the below link
  https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1prEplXrwZ7TI-4f_sfyrprMyovF2ii78?usp=sharing. Kindly note the data processing will take time so we have to remain patient to get the final data.

To understand more kindly go through the presentation cps_part2.ppt.
